# Exploring-The-Possiblility-of-Forcasting-Stock-Prices

Stock forecasting is the process of predicting the future prices of a stock based on previous historical data. With the introduction of machine learning techniques and the use of Big data, traders have claimed to have begun having success in predicting the stock market.
    
The main idea of this work will be to highlight if machine learning can be used to forecast stock prices. In the process we will examine the theory of each algorithm and view the effectiveness of each algorithm 
We will be implementing 3 Algorithms on the feature dataset:
   
    Linear Regression
    Decision Tree
    Recurrent Neural Network
